    <h1>zomg where did the content go</h1>
    <p>Dude, whatever page you're looking for is not here. You're going to have to
      come to terms with that. There's a solid chance you can find the correct link
      <a href="/">on this page</a>, though. Go check it out. I'll wait.</p>

    <p>Christ, you're taking forever. Go find the damn thing already, okay? I'm done
      waiting. I'm going to get some gin and drink away this embarrasing situation
      from my memory.</p>

    <p>The good news is that I found the gin, but I had to set fire to a small
      Irishman to get it. I don't know why the Irishman had the gin - it seems
      culturally inappropriate - but he did and now it is getting drunked by me. IF
      ONLY YOU HAD FOUND THE RIGHT LINK HOURS AGO THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPEND.</p>

    <p>Hearts and kisses,</p>

    <p>43waves.</p>
